# JavaScript Loose Comparison and Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to loose comparison (`==`) and handling `null` values.  Loose comparison can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values of different types.

The `bug.js` file contains the faulty code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version using strict equality (`===`).  The issue is explained in more detail in the comments within the code files.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js` to see the unexpected output.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected output.

## Solution

The solution involves using strict equality (`===`) instead of loose equality (`==`) when comparing values, especially when checking for `null` or `undefined`.  Strict equality ensures that both the value and type are compared, preventing unexpected results due to type coercion.
